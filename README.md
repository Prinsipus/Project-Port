# Project-Port
Photorealistic Upgrade on the main port of Chios using Lumion, AutoCAD and Fusion360.
Had a long term project with a friend, to create a photorealistic "upgrade" on the main port of Chios Island for a client.
Τhe project was implemented with the use of AutoCADⓇ and Fusion360Ⓡ by Autodesk and LumionⓇ.
Took several days to finish but the result left our customer satisfied and with a bright smile! :P
